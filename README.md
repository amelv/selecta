A Crate Digging Tool for DJs to get recommendations from Spotify.

![App Preview](./public/selecta.png)

## Project Structure

This is a Next 13 project, using the app router and hosted on Vercel. Currently I'm using Context Providers to handle the recommendation state in the app, and talking to the API to make Spotify calls from the server.

- `/src/app` - NextJS App
- `/src/app/api` - API Routes
- `/src/components` - Basic Components
- `/src/provider` - Recommendations / AudioPlayer Context
- `/src/lib` - Various re-usable code and Spotify library
