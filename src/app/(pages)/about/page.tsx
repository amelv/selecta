      <h1>What is Selecta?</h1>
      <p>
        Selecta is an app designed to enhance your Spotify
        experience. Spotify is huge - it's home to over{" "}
        <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/company-info/" target="_blank">
          100 million songs
        </a>{" "}
        and if you&apos;re a regular user, you know just how good it is at
        finding tracks you love. Just the sort you&apos;d like to stumble across
        on your own. That&apos;s where Selecta comes in. Selecta is a way to
        place a special order with Spotify, and fine-tune the dials to find
        the tracks you didn&apos;t know you were looking for.
